def create_guest_session():
    '''
    This method will let you create a new guest session.
    Guest sessions are a type of session that will let a user rate movies and TV shows but not require them to have a TMDb user account.
    More information about user authentication can be found https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/authentication/how-do-i-generate-a-session-id.

    Please note, you should only generate a single guest session per user (or device) as you will be able to attach the ratings to a TMDb user account in the future.
    There is also IP limits in place so you should always make sure it's the end user doing the guest session actions.

    If a guest session is not used for the first time within 24 hours, it will be automatically deleted.

    '''
    This method allows an application to validate a request token by entering a username and password.

    Not all applications have access to a web view so this can be used as a substitute.

    Please note, the preferred method of validating a request token is to have a user authenticate the request via the TMDb website.
    You can read about that method https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/authentication/how-do-i-generate-a-session-id.

    If you decide to use this method please use HTTPS.
